    "## NumPy Vectorization and Broadcasting\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is one of the core Python packages used in Data Science and Machine Learning. NumPy is short for Numerical Python. The key data structure that is provided by the NumPy package are arrays, called NumPy arrays. These are similar to Python lists. The NumPy package provides a number of different functions for both creating arrays of different sizes, shapes, and types, and for performing various operations on array elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will become familiar with NumPy arrays and key NumPy techniques called vectorization and broadcasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Broadcasting</b>: Arrays with different sizes cannot be added, subtracted, or generally be used in arithmetic. A way to overcome this is to duplicate the smaller array so that it is the same dimensionality and size as the larger array. This is called array broadcasting and is available in NumPy when performing array arithmetic. This can greatly reduce and simplify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Vectorization</b>: \n",
    "NumPy provides functions that can perform mathematical operations on arrays that would otherwise be performed through the use of for loops. This is a process that is referred to as vectorization. Essentially, instead of using loops to perform certain computations, you can use an available NumPy function. Therefore, if there is a NumPy function available to fit your needs, always use it so as to get much faster performance!\n",

By \"conventional shorthand names,\" we mean that it is an agreed-upon convention by the community to use these particular shorthand names, but there is nothing that would stop you from choosing your own shorthand name, or not using a shorthand name at all. In this program, we will use `np` as the shorthand name for the `numpy` package, and we will import the `numpy` package in as follows:  `import numpy as np`.\n",
