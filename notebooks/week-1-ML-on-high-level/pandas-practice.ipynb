    "### DataFrame Indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, DataFrames are two-dimensional tables, labeled by row and column names, containing a set of column-oriented data such that each column has a particular datatype (dtype). Like Python lists, Pandas DataFrames use 0-based indexing. That is, the first row in a DataFrame has an index of 0 and the first column in a DataFrame has an index of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be familair with indexing, which is the process of accessing elements of data in a data structure such as a list or a dictionary by specifying which element(s) one is interested in. Just as you can index into Python lists and dictionaries, you can also index into Pandas DataFrames. Because DataFrames have row and column labels (names), Pandas provides a very useful ability to index, either based on those labels or on the positions of rows and columns. For example: Python lists and NumPy arrays are indexed by integer position (e.g., ```my_list[3]``` or ```my_array[5,7]```), while Python dictionaries are indexed by keys (e.g., ```my_dict['name']```).  Because Pandas DataFrames contain data in a positional order, *and* have row and column labels, they can be indexed both by position and by label. You can also \"slice\" a Pandas DataFrame. Slicing allows you to select a subset of rows or columns from the DataFrame. Just as with Python lists, slicing is supported using the colon operator ```:``` (you can also use the colon operator to slice into NumPy arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mechanisms for indexing and Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and slicing DataFrames can be done through various mechanisms: \n",
    "\n",
    "* ```[]```\n",
    "* ```loc[]```\n",
    "* ```iloc[]```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first of these, ```[]```, is the square-bracket based indexing that we are familiar with from Python lists and  dictionaries.  Because Pandas DataFrames are generally column-oriented, however, indexing with square brackets results in selecting a particular column based on its label. Each column in the DataFrame is of the Pandas Series datatype, which is a one-dimensional array, similar to a NumPy array. We can loosely think of a DataFrame as something like a dictionary of Series objects: each column label is like a key, and the value associated with that key is the data in that particular column, which is a Pandas Series.  For example, ```df['x2']``` will extract the column labeled 'x2' and will return a Series. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can slice a DataFrame using square-bracket based indexing. This will allow you to slice the rows in the DataFrame using an integer range. For example, `df[:3]` will return the first three rows in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing and slicing a DataFrame using ```loc``` is more general, in that it enables you to access both rows and columns based on their labels.  It uses the same sort of multi-dimensional indexing that you may have seen with other data structures (e.g. `[][]`), although with row and/or column labels rather than integer positional indexes.  By this we mean that the first entry in an index refers to row label, and the second index refers to a column label.  If only one entry is specified, it is used to identify a row in a DataFrame. The syntax for `loc` is `DataFrame_obj.loc[]` or `DataFrame_obj.loc[][]`. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `iloc` allows you to access rows and columns with specific integer positions (integer-based indexing). The syntax for `iloc` is `DataFrame_obj.iloc[]` or `DataFrame_obj.iloc[][]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the steps below, you will practice indexing and slicing a DataFrame using some of the above methods.  Online Pandas documentation describing indexing and slicing in great detail can be found [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html).\n",
